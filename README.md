I am a computational biologist. My work focuses on using simulation, computational modeling and
data science tools to uncover how cells function. In particular, I am currently using all-atom molecular
dynamics simulations to study proteins critical for heart function as part of the Center for Translational Muscle Research. My work has also spanned continuum scale modeling to study fluid flow in muscle cells, timing of muscle motions and mechanical deformations of the cell membrane.


## Tools

* Python
 - Pandas, Scipy, etc. for data science
 - xGBoost and some neural nets with Keras

* Modeling and simulations
 - Amber (all-atom molecular dynamics)
 - COMSOL (finite element software for fluid dynamics)
 - Solving systems of ODEs for BVPs (Python)

* Qualitative analysis and project management
 - GitHub (software version control and collaboration)
 - Quirkos (qualtitative literature review)
 - Latex (collaborative document formatting)
