I am a computational biologist. My work focuses on using simulation, computational modeling and
data science tools to uncover how cells function. In particular, I am currently using all-atom molecular
dynamics simulations to study proteins critical for heart function as part of the Center for Translational Muscle Research. My work has also spanned continuum scale modeling to study fluid flow in muscle cells, timing of muscle motions and mechanical deformations of the cell membrane.
