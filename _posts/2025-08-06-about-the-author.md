I am a computational biologist. My work focuses on using simulation, computational modeling and data science tools to uncover how cells and biological systems function. My work has spanned continuum scale modeling to study fluid flow in muscle cells, and the deformation of cell membranes and using experimental techniques to measure the timing of muscle motions. Currently, I'm using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to study proteins critical for heart function as part of the Center for Translational Muscle Research.

In addition to research, I am an educator. The University of Washington's Biology department is heavily invested in evidence-based teaching practice to facilitate student success. So from day one of TA-ing Biology classes I was surrounded by student-centered practice. I've sought out opportunities to learn more, from auditing an "Evidence-based teaching" class to get an understanding of the education research literature to pursuing hands on experience through a mentored opportunity to develop and teach a class (STEP-WISE).

Education happens both in the classroom and outside of it, and creating opportunities to improve training is a major motivator for how I do my work. Recently, that's taken the form of documenting and streamlining processes to make learning complex computational procedures easier.
