Learning Unix shell scripting can be intimidating. Last week I co-lead a Unix shell workshop based on Software Carpentry’ course materials to help students get their footing.

Teaching this workshop was meaningful for me because when I was in college I kept losing my homework for my Java I class. The professor helped me ferret out the problem: I hadn't realized that computers had a "Documents" folder, thinking at the time that if a file wasn't visible on the Desktop it didn't exist. By the end of the semester, this same professor suggested I should consider majoring in Computer Science, but I felt far too out of place to even sign up for Java II. In my experience, competence along isn't enough -- a learner also needs confidence when it comes to coding. And perhaps even more so when operating on the command line.

For this workshop, we used the material from Software Carpentry's "Introducing the Shell" lesson. The Carpentries do an excellent job of bringing all learners onto the same page and unpacking all of the overhead knowledge. When you're used to using the command line, it's easy to forget that symbols like the `$` indicating a prompt, or the `-` signaling that you're specifying an option for a command are not obvious to a beginner. And the pacing of the material helps build confidence.

I noticed as we worked to get all of the students to the downloaded lesson data that for some Windows users with One Drive that it took me a few tries to help them navigate their file directory. As an instructor it can feel destabilizing to struggle in front of students, but in this workshop it was useful. They saw real time that getting an error message isn't the end of the world. In practice, when I get an error message in my day-to-day work I will try other options or look up more about the function I'm using, which is a good process for a student to see.

At the end of the workshop, one of the students commented that previous courses had moved too fast, but that this one actually helped to build confidence. I’m glad to have worked with Dave Beck and the Center for Translational Muscle Research to help 17 students build confidence with shell. By the end of the workshop, all students who completed the follow up survey had increased their comfort level on the command line, which was a big win. And, to top it off, one participant said "Sage made everything relatable and understandable, and made all the components of what we learned easily accessible." -- I couldn't be more encouraged than I am hearing that. One area that I hope to grow in for future workshops is setting up students who are moving at a faster pace with prompts to push their learning forward while all students achieve the baseline.  

And if you’re looking to learn? Check out the Software Carpentries, the eScience Institute or keep an eye on the CTMR’s webpage for upcoming workshops.
