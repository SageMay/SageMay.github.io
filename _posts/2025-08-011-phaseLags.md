Picture this: you're trying to understand the relationship between several noisy time series data.
Maybe you're looking at consumer purchasing habits, maybe the timing of insect and flower life stages, or maybe electricity usage.
One thing these signals have in common is they have underlying periodicity.
That was the case for my data.

I wanted to understand how muscle's sub-cellular machinery works together.
Our experiment was setup to measure how the lattice of molecular machinery changes shape as the flight muscle of a large moth contracted and relaxed during flight.
And not just for one moth, but for several.
One thing was clear looking at the raw data: while there was underlying periodicity, there was also a lot of noise from wing beat to wing beat for several of the traces.
But based on my understanding of the muscle, I wondered if there were relationships between the timing of signals within every wingbeat.


To understand the relationship between these signals, I used the cross correlation at various phase lags.
This revealed that some
